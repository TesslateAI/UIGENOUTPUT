    <div><h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-[var(--color-primary)] mb-1">Prompt:</h2><pre>Make a simple interaction component with a hover effect and a click animation</pre></div>
    
    <div class="mt-3"><h3 class="font-semibold mb-1">Text Before HTML:</h3><pre>We are going to create a simple interaction component with a hover effect and a click animation.
 The component will be a button that has:
   - A hover effect: when the mouse hovers over the button, it changes color and maybe scales up a bit.
   - A click animation: when the button is clicked, it will have a quick animation (like a scale down and then back) to give a pressed effect.

 We'll use Tailwind CSS for styling and vanilla JavaScript for the click animation.

 Steps:
 1. We'll create a button element with some text.
 2. We'll define the base styles for the button (background, text color, padding, border-radius, etc.)
 3. We'll define the hover styles (background color change and a slight scale transformation).
 4. We'll define a click animation that will be triggered by JavaScript: when the button is clicked, we'll add a class that scales the button down and then back to its original size.

 We'll use the following approach for the click animation:
   - On click, we add a class that sets a transition for the transform property and then immediately sets a transform: scale(0.95) and opacity to 0.8.
   - Then, we remove that class after a short delay (like 100ms) to allow the transition to happen, and then we remove the class to reset the button.

 Alternatively, we can use a CSS animation that we trigger by adding a class on click. We'll do:

   .btn {
      transition: transform 0.1s ease, opacity 0.1s ease;
   }

   .btn:active {
      transform: scale(0.95);
      opacity: 0.8;
   }

 But note: the :active state is only while the button is being pressed. We want a quick animation that happens on click and then returns to normal.

 We can also do:

   .btn {
      transition: transform 0.1s ease, opacity 0.1s ease;
   }

   .btn.clicked {
      transform: scale(0.95);
      opacity: 0.8;
   }

   Then in JS: 
      button.addEventListener('click', function() {
         this.classList.add('clicked');
         setTimeout(() => {
            this.classList.remove('clicked');
         }, 100);
      });

 However, we can also do it with CSS only by using the :active state and a transition, but that would require a transition on the transform and opacity for the :active state? Actually, we can set the transition on the normal state and then change in :active.

 But note: the :active state is only when the button is being pressed. We want the animation to happen on the click (which is when the mouse is pressed and released). We want a visual feedback on the press.

 Alternatively, we can use a CSS animation that we trigger by adding a class. But let's do it with a class that we add and remove.

 However, for simplicity and to avoid JavaScript, we can use:

   .btn {
      transition: transform 0.1s ease, opacity 0.1s ease;
   }

   .btn:active {
      transform: scale(0.95);
      opacity: 0.8;
   }

 This will work for mouse clicks. But what about touch devices? It might work for touch as well.

 But note: the :active state is also triggered on touch devices when the element is pressed.

 So we can do without JavaScript? Let's try.

 However, the requirement says "click animation", and we want it to be a quick animation. The :active state will do that.

 But we also want a hover effect. So we'll have:

   .btn:hover {
      background-color: ...;
      transform: scale(1.05); /* a bit larger on hover */
   }

   .btn:active {
      transform: scale(0.95); /* smaller on click */
   }

 But note: when we click, the button will go from hover (scale 1.05) to active (scale 0.95). That might be a bit jarring.

 We can set the transform on hover and then on active we override it? Yes.

 Alternatively, we can set the transform on hover and then on active we set a more specific transform? But we can also set the active to have a transform that is relative to the base, not the hover.

 How about we set the base transform to 1, and then on hover we set to 1.05, and on active we set to 0.95? Then the active will override the hover.

 But note: the active state is more specific than hover? Actually, they are both pseudo-classes and have the same specificity. So we need to use !important or set the active in a more specific way? Or we can set the active in the same rule and it will override because it's written after.

 Actually, in CSS, if two rules have the same specificity, the one that comes later in the style sheet wins.

 So we can do:

   .btn {
      ... 
      transform: scale(1);
      transition: transform 0.1s ease, opacity 0.1s ease;
   }

   .btn:hover {
      transform: scale(1.05);
   }

   .btn:active {
      transform: scale(0.95);
      opacity: 0.8;
   }

 But note: the transition will apply to the transform and opacity. So when we hover, it will transition from 1 to 1.05. When we click, it will transition from 1.05 to 0.95? But the active state is set when the button is pressed, so the transition will be from the current state (which is 1.05) to 0.95? That might be a bit faster? Actually, the transition duration is 0.1s, so it will be a quick 0.1s.

 However, we might want the active state to be immediate? But the transition is set on the transform, so it will transition.

 Alternatively, we can set the active state without transition? But then we don't get the animation.

 Let's try to set the active state without transition? But we want the active state to be a quick animation? Actually, we want the active state to be a quick change? But the requirement says "click animation", so we want it to be smooth.

 We can set the active state to have a transition of 0.1s? But then it will transition from the current state (hover) to the active state? That might be acceptable.

 But note: when we release the mouse, it will transition back to the hover state? That might be two transitions: one when we press (active) and one when we release (hover). We want the active state to be only when the button is pressed.

 So we can do:

   .btn {
      transform: scale(1);
      transition: transform 0.1s ease, opacity 0.1s ease;
   }

   .btn:hover {
      transform: scale(1.05);
   }

   .btn:active {
      transform: scale(0.95);
      opacity: 0.8;
   }

 This will work.

 However, we might want to reset the opacity? Because when we release, it will go back to the hover state (which doesn't have opacity) and then transition back to 1.05? But the hover state doesn't have opacity, so it will transition from 0.8 to 1? But we set the active state to have opacity:0.8 and the hover state doesn't set opacity? Then when we release, the button will transition from 0.8 to 1? That might be acceptable.

 Alternatively, we can set the hover state to have opacity:1? But then we are changing opacity on hover? We don't need to.

 Let's keep it simple: only transform.

 But the requirement says "click animation", and we are using the active state to animate. So we'll do:

   .btn {
      background-color: ...;
      color: ...;
      padding: ...;
      border-radius: ...;
      transform: scale(1);
      transition: transform 0.1s ease;
   }

   .btn:hover {
      transform: scale(1.05);
   }

   .btn:active {
      transform: scale(0.95);
   }

 This will give a nice effect.

 But note: the active state might be too much if the button is already scaled on hover? We can adjust the values.

 Alternatively, we can set the active state to be relative to the base? But we are setting absolute values.

 We can also use a different approach: on hover, we set a transform: scale(1.05), and then on active, we set a transform: scale(0.95) relative to the current? But CSS doesn't do relative transforms in that way.

 So we'll stick with absolute.

 Let's choose colors: 
   base: blue-500
   hover: blue-600

 We'll create a button with text "Click Me"

 We'll also add a shadow and maybe a border.

 We'll make it a simple component.

 We'll also add a ripple effect? The requirement doesn't say, but the template had a ripple effect in the buttons. We can do a simple one with CSS.

 However, the requirement is for a hover effect and a click animation. We'll do the hover and active as above.

 But if we want a ripple, we can do:

   .btn:after {
      content: '';
      position: absolute;
      top: 50%;
      left: 50%;
      width: 5px;
      height: 5px;
      background: rgba(255,255,255,0.5);
      opacity: 0;
      border-radius: 100%;
      transform: scale(1, 1) translate(-50%);
      transform-origin: 50% 50%;
   }

   .btn:active:after {
      animation: ripple 0.6s linear;
   }

   @keyframes ripple {
      0% {
         transform: scale(0, 0);
         opacity: 0.5;
      }
      100% {
         transform: scale(15, 15);
         opacity: 0;
      }
   }

 But that might be too much for a simple component? The requirement doesn't specify ripple, but the template had it. We can do it if we want.

 Since the requirement says "simple", we'll stick to the transform and opacity for the click.

 But let's do the ripple effect as well? It's a common pattern.

 We'll do:

   We'll create a button with position: relative.

   Then we add a pseudo-element for the ripple.

   On active, we trigger the ripple animation.

   We'll use the same ripple animation as in the template? The template had:

        .ripple:after {
            content: "";
            display: block;
            position: absolute;
            width: 100%;
            height: 100%;
            top: 0;
            left: 0;
            pointer-events: none;
            background-image: radial-gradient(circle, #fff 10%, transparent 10.01%);
            background-repeat: no-repeat;
            background-position: 50%;
            transform: scale(10, 10);
            opacity: 0;
            transition: transform .5s, opacity 1s;
        }

        .ripple:active:after {
            transform: scale(0, 0);
            opacity: .3;
            transition: 0s;
        }

   But note: that ripple is a white circle that expands. We can adjust.

   We'll do:

        .btn {
            position: relative;
            overflow: hidden;
            ... other styles ...
        }

        .btn:after {
            content: '';
            position: absolute;
            top: 50%;
            left: 50%;
            width: 5px;
            height: 5px;
            background: rgba(255,255,255,0.5);
            opacity: 0;
            border-radius: 100%;
            transform: scale(1, 1) translate(-50%);
            transform-origin: 50% 50%;
        }

        .btn:active:after {
            animation: ripple 0.6s linear;
        }

        @keyframes ripple {
            0% {
                transform: scale(0, 0);
                opacity: 0.5;
            }
            100% {
                transform: scale(15, 15);
                opacity: 0;
            }
        }

   But note: the ripple might be too big? We can adjust the scale and the size.

   Alternatively, we can do a radial gradient? But the template used a radial gradient.

   We'll do the radial gradient as in the template? But the template's ripple was for a dark background.

   We'll do:

        .btn:after {
            content: "";
            display: block;
            position: absolute;
            width: 100%;
            height: 100%;
            top: 0;
            left: 0;
            pointer-events: none;
            background-image: radial-gradient(circle, rgba(255,255,255,0.5) 10%, transparent 10.01%);
            background-repeat: no-repeat;
            background-position: 50%;
            transform: scale(10, 10);
            opacity: 0;
            transition: transform 0.5s, opacity 1s;
        }

        .btn:active:after {
            transform: scale(0, 0);
            opacity: 0.3;
            transition: 0s;
        }

   But note: the transition: transform 0.5s, opacity 1s; is set on the :after element? Then when we set :active, we change the transform and opacity and set the transition to 0s? That might not work because the transition is set on the normal state.

   We can set the transition on the :after element and then on active, we override the transition to 0s? But we can do:

        .btn:after {
            ... 
            transition: transform 0.5s, opacity 1s;
        }

        .btn:active:after {
            transition: 0s;
            transform: scale(0, 0);
            opacity: 0.3;
        }

   But the transition property is set on the :after element and then we change it in :active? That should work.

   However, the requirement is for a simple component. We can do without the ripple? But the template had it. We'll do it.

   We'll also note that the ripple effect might not be supported in very old browsers? But we are using modern CSS.

   We'll do the ripple effect as in the template? But we'll adjust the colors to match our button.

   Our button background is blue-500, so the ripple should be white? But in the template, the button was dark, so the ripple was white. We'll do the same.

   We'll set the ripple to be white.

   So:

        .btn:after {
            content: "";
            display: block;
            position: absolute;
            width: 100%;
            height: 100%;
            top: 0;
            left: 0;
            pointer-events: none;
            background-image: radial-gradient(circle, rgba(255,255,255,0.5) 10%, transparent 10.01%);
            background-repeat: no-repeat;
            background-position: 50%;
            transform: scale(10, 10);
            opacity: 0;
            transition: transform 0.5s, opacity 1s;
        }

        .btn:active:after {
            transform: scale(0, 0);
            opacity: 0.3;
            transition: 0s;
        }

   This will create a ripple effect when the button is clicked.

   We'll also set the button to have overflow: hidden so that the ripple doesn't go outside.

   So the button must have:

        position: relative;
        overflow: hidden;

   And the :after element is inside.

   We'll also set the button to have a background color and text color.

   Let's code:

   We'll create a button with class "btn" and the ripple effect.

   We'll also add the hover and active transforms.

   We'll use:

        .btn {
            @apply bg-blue-500 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded-full shadow-lg;
            position: relative;
            overflow: hidden;
            transform: scale(1);
            transition: transform 0.1s ease;
        }

        .btn:hover {
            transform: scale(1.05);
        }

        .btn:active {
            transform: scale(0.95);
        }

        .btn:after {
            content: "";
            display: block;
            position: absolute;
            width: 100%;
            height: 100%;
            top: 0;
            left: 0;
            pointer-events: none;
            background-image: radial-gradient(circle, rgba(255,255,255,0.5) 10%, transparent 10.01%);
            background-repeat: no-repeat;
            background-position: 50%;
            transform: scale(10, 10);
            opacity: 0;
            transition: transform 0.5s, opacity 1s;
        }

        .btn:active:after {
            transform: scale(0, 0);
            opacity: 0.3;
            transition: 0s;
        }

   We'll also add a z-index to the button so that the ripple is above the button? But the :after is already on top.

   We'll test.

   We'll also note that the active transform (scale(0.95)) might conflict with the ripple? But the ripple is an absolute element, so it should be independent.

   We'll also note that the active transform might cause the button to shrink and then the ripple might be cut off? We can set the button to have a fixed size? Or we can set the button to have min-width and min-height? Or we can set the button to have a fixed size? But we want it to be responsive.

   Alternatively, we can set the button to have a fixed width and height? But we don't know the content.

   We can set the button to have a fixed padding? We did py-2 px-4.

   We'll see.

   We'll create the HTML:

        <button class="btn">Click Me</button>

   We'll also add a little margin to see it.

   We'll put it in a container with some padding.

   We'll also note that the ripple effect might not be visible if the button is too small? We'll set the button to be at least 100px? Or we can adjust the ripple to be smaller? The template had a button that was a circle.

   We'll make the button a circle? Or we can make it a circle? The template had a circle button.

   We'll do:

        .btn {
            @apply bg-blue-500 text-white font-bold w-12 h-12 rounded-full shadow-lg flex items-center justify-center;
            ... 
        }

   Then the button will be a circle with the text in the center.

   We'll change the text to an icon? Or we can keep the text.

   We'll do the text "C" for click? Or we can do "Click". But in a circle, it might be too small.

   We'll do an icon? We can use an SVG.

   We'll do a simple circle with a plus icon? But the requirement doesn't specify.

   We'll do a circle with the text "C" for now.

   We'll also note that the ripple effect in the template was for a circle button.

   We'll do:

        <button class="btn">
            <span class="text-lg">C</span>
        </button>

   We'll adjust the padding? We set w-12 h-12 and then the text in the center.

   We'll also add a hover effect that is a bit more? We can do a shadow on hover? We already have shadow.

   We'll do:

        .btn:hover {
            transform: scale(1.05);
            box-shadow: 0 0 0 4px rgba(59, 130, 246, 0.4); /* blue-500 with opacity */
        }

   This will give a glow on hover.

   We'll also note that the active state will remove the glow? Because we are setting the transform and not the shadow? We can set the active state to have a different shadow? But we are already scaling.

   We'll leave the shadow as is.

   We'll now code the entire component.

   We'll also note that we are using Tailwind, so we can use the classes.

   We'll write the CSS in a style tag? Or we can use Tailwind and then add custom styles? We'll do:

        We'll use Tailwind classes for the base, and then we'll add a style tag for the ripple and the active transform.

   But we can also use the @apply in a style tag? Or we can use a separate CSS file? But the requirement is for a component, so we'll put everything in one HTML file.

   We'll do:

        <style>
            .btn {
                position: relative;
                overflow: hidden;
                transform: scale(1);
                transition: transform 0.1s ease;
            }

            .btn:hover {
                transform: scale(1.05);
                box-shadow: 0 0 0 4px rgba(59, 130, 246, 0.4);
            }

            .btn:active {
                transform: scale(0.95);
            }

            .btn:after {
                content: "";
                display: block;
                position: absolute;
                width: 100%;
                height: 100%;
                top: 0;
                left: 0;
                pointer-events: none;
                background-image: radial-gradient(circle, rgba(255,255,255,0.5) 10%, transparent 10.01%);
                background-repeat: no-repeat;
                background-position: 50%;
                transform: scale(10, 10);
                opacity: 0;
                transition: transform 0.5s, opacity 1s;
            }

            .btn:active:after {
                transform: scale(0, 0);
                opacity: 0.3;
                transition: 0s;
            }
        </style>

   And then the button:

        <button class="bg-blue-500 text-white font-bold w-12 h-12 rounded-full shadow-lg flex items-center justify-center btn">
            C
        </button>

   We'll also add a container to center it.

   We'll do:

        <div class="min-h-screen flex items-center justify-center bg-gray-100">
            <button class="bg-blue-500 text-white font-bold w-12 h-12 rounded-full shadow-lg flex items-center justify-center btn">
                C
            </button>
        </div>

   We'll also note that the ripple effect might not be visible if the button is too small? We can adjust the ripple to be smaller? The template had a button that was bigger.

   We'll make the button bigger: w-16 h-16.

   We'll change to:

        <button class="bg-blue-500 text-white font-bold w-16 h-16 rounded-full shadow-lg flex items-center justify-center btn">
            C
        </button>

   We'll also add a hover effect that changes the background color? We can do:

        .btn:hover {
            background-color: blue-600;
            transform: scale(1.05);
            box-shadow: 0 0 0 4px rgba(59, 130, 246, 0.4);
        }

   But we are using Tailwind, so we can use:

        .btn:hover {
            @apply bg-blue-600;
        }

   But we are in a style tag? We can do:

        .btn:hover {
            background-color: #3b82f6; /* blue-600 */
        }

   We'll do that.

   We'll also note that the active state should change the background color? We can set:

        .btn:active {
            background-color: blue-700;
            transform: scale(0.95);
        }

   But we are already setting the transform. We can set the background-color in the active state? But we are using a transition for transform, so the background-color change will be immediate? We want it to be smooth? We can add a transition for background-color? But the requirement doesn't specify.

   We'll do without background-color change on active? Or we can do:

        .btn {
            transition: transform 0.1s ease, background-color 0.1s ease;
        }

        .btn:active {
            background-color: #2563eb; /* blue-700 */
            transform: scale(0.95);
        }

   We'll do that.

   We'll also note that the ripple effect is independent.

   We'll now write the code.

   We'll also note that the ripple effect might be too bright? We can adjust the opacity.

   We'll do:

        .btn:after {
            background-image: radial-gradient(circle, rgba(255,255,255,0.3) 10%, transparent 10.01%);
        }

   And then on active, we set opacity:0.3? We already set opacity:0.3 in active:after.

   We'll try.

   We'll also note that the ripple effect might be too fast? We can adjust the transition? But the template had 0.5s for transform and 1s for opacity? We'll keep it.

   We'll now write the entire HTML.

   We'll also note that we are using Tailwind, so we need to include Tailwind.

   We'll use the CDN.

   We'll do:

        <head>
            <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
            <style>
                ... our custom styles ...
            </style>
        </head>

   We'll also set the body to have a background.

   We'll do:

        <body class="bg-gray-100 min-h-screen flex items-center justify-center">
            <button class="bg-blue-500 text-white font-bold w-16 h-16 rounded-full shadow-lg flex items-center justify-center btn">
                C
            </button>
        </body>

   We'll also add a little margin to the button so that the ripple doesn't go off the screen? We can set the button container to have padding.

   We'll do:

        <div class="p-4">
            <button class="...">C</button>
        </div>

   We'll now write the code.

   We'll also note that the ripple effect might not be visible on the first click? We'll test.

   We'll also note that the active state might be too small? We can adjust the scale to 0.98? But 0.95 is common.

   We'll do 0.95.

   We'll now write the code.
