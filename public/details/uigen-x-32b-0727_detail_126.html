    <div class="mt-3"><h3 class="font-semibold mb-1">Text Before HTML:</h3><pre>We are going to create a 3D animation of a product launch with a rotating camera and particle effects.
 Since we are using Tailwind CSS and vanilla JavaScript, we cannot use Three.js or similar libraries without including them.
 However, note that the template provided does not include any 3D library. We are to stick to the template's style and complexity.

 But note: The requirement is for a 3D animation. Without a 3D library, we cannot create true 3D. 
 We can simulate a 3D effect with CSS 3D transforms and perspective, but it's limited.

 Alternatively, we can use a canvas and WebGL for 3D, but that would require including a library like Three.js and writing more complex code.

 Given the constraints of the problem (using Tailwind and vanilla JS, and the template style), we have two options:

 Option 1: Create a 2D representation with CSS animations and particle effects (using CSS or canvas) and simulate a rotating camera with CSS transforms.

 Option 2: Use a simple 3D effect with CSS 3D transforms and perspective, but note that it won't be as rich as a WebGL scene.

 However, the problem says "3D animation", so we should try to achieve a 3D look.

 Since the template uses a dark theme with gradients and modern design, we'll design accordingly.

 We'll create:
   - A product (represented as a 3D object using CSS 3D transforms and multiple faces)
   - A rotating camera effect by rotating the container (or the product) and changing the perspective
   - Particle effects using CSS or a simple canvas

 But note: The template does not include any 3D library, so we have to use CSS 3D.

 Steps for the product:
   We can create a cube with 6 faces (using divs) and use `transform: rotateX, rotateY` to show different faces.

 However, for a product launch, we might have a more complex shape. But for simplicity, we'll use a cube.

 Alternatively, we can use a sphere or a cylinder? But CSS 3D is limited to simple shapes.

 We'll create a cube and rotate it continuously.

 For the particle effect, we can use a canvas or create many small divs and animate them with JavaScript.

 Given the complexity, we'll use a canvas for the particle effect to have more control.

 We'll structure the page:

   - A section with a dark background.
   - A container for the 3D product and the particle canvas.
   - The product cube in the center, rotating.
   - A canvas for the particle effect that covers the entire viewport or a part of it.

 We'll use the same color scheme as the template: dark background, purple and yellow accents.

 Let's define the colors in the tailwind config:

   primary-purple: rgb(81, 47, 235)
   primary-yellow: rgb(255, 207, 101)

 We'll create a new section for the product launch.

 We'll also include the necessary JavaScript for:
   - Rotating the cube
   - Creating and animating particles

 However, note that the template already has a lot of JavaScript for the existing features. We'll add our code at the end.

 Steps:

  1. Add a new section for the product launch.
  2. In that section, create a container for the 3D product and the canvas.
  3. Create the cube with 6 faces (each face is a div with background color or image).
  4. Set up CSS for the cube to be in 3D space (using transform-style: preserve-3d and perspective).
  5. Animate the cube rotation with keyframes.
  6. Set up a canvas for the particle effect and draw particles with JavaScript.

 But note: The template uses Tailwind, so we'll use Tailwind classes for layout and some styling, and then custom CSS for the 3D cube.

 We'll add the section after the "Key Features" section for example.

 Let's call it "Product Showcase".

 We'll create:

   <section id="product-showcase" class="py-24 md:py-32 lg:py-48 bg-[var(--color-bg-dark)]">
     ... content ...
   </section>

 Inside, we'll have:

   <div class="container mx-auto px-4">
     <div class="text-center ..."> ... title and description ... </div>
     <div class="relative h-[500px] w-full flex justify-center items-center">
        <div class="product-cube-container" style="perspective: 1000px;">
          <div class="product-cube">
            <div class="face front">...</div>
            <div class="face back">...</div>
            ... other faces ...
          </div>
        </div>
        <canvas id="particles" class="absolute inset-0 w-full h-full"></canvas>
     </div>
   </div>

 For the cube:

   .product-cube-container {
      transform-style: preserve-3d;
      transform: rotateX(10deg) rotateY(-10deg); /* initial rotation */
      animation: rotate 20s infinite linear;
   }

   .product-cube {
      display: flex;
      flex-direction: column;
      justify-content: center;
      align-items: center;
      width: 200px;
      height: 200px;
   }

   .face {
      position: absolute;
      width: 100%;
      height: 100%;
      background: ...;
      border: 1px solid var(--color-border-light);
   }

   Then position each face with transform: translateZ, rotateX, rotateY to position in 3D.

   For example, the front face: transform: translateZ(100px);
   the back face: transform: translateZ(-100px);
   the top face: transform: rotateX(90deg) translateZ(100px);
   ... etc.

 For the particles:

   We'll create a canvas and draw many small circles (particles) that move around.

   We'll use the same color scheme: purple and yellow.

   We'll create a function to create particles and update their positions.

   We'll use the canvas to clear and redraw on each frame.

 Given the complexity, we'll only do a basic particle effect.

 We'll add the JavaScript for the particles and cube rotation at the end of the existing script.

 However, note: the cube rotation might conflict with the camera rotation? Actually, we are rotating the entire cube container.

 We are going to have the cube rotating continuously, and the camera (which is the view) is fixed? 
 But the problem says "rotating camera". We can simulate a rotating camera by rotating the container of the cube in the opposite direction? 
 Or we can rotate the cube and the background particles to give the illusion of a rotating camera.

 Alternatively, we can rotate the entire scene (the cube and the particles) in the opposite direction to simulate the camera rotating.

 But for simplicity, we'll just rotate the cube and have the particles fixed? Or we can rotate the particles in the opposite direction.

 We'll do:

   The cube rotates around the Y axis (like a product on a stand).

   The particles are emitted from the product and fly outward.

   We'll have the particles move in random directions and also rotate with the cube? Actually, we want the particles to be in the scene and not attached to the cube.

   So we'll have the cube rotate, and the particles are in the background and do not rotate with the cube? 

   But then the particles would appear to rotate with the cube? Because the cube is in the center and the particles are around.

   We want the camera to rotate around the product? That would be a different effect.

   We can do:

      We'll keep the cube fixed and rotate the camera (the view) around the cube? But in CSS, we don't have a camera.

   Alternatively, we can simulate a rotating camera by rotating the entire container (including the cube and the particles) in the opposite direction.

   We'll have:

      <div class="product-container" style="transform: rotateY(-10deg); animation: rotate 20s infinite linear;">

        <div class="product-cube-container" style="transform-style: preserve-3d; transform: rotateY(10deg);">
          ... cube ...
        </div>

        <canvas> ... </canvas>

      </div>

   Then the product-container rotates, and inside we have the cube-container that rotates in the opposite direction so that the cube appears fixed? 
   Actually, we want the cube to rotate independently? 

   Let me think: We want the camera to rotate around the product. So the product should stay fixed, and the background (particles) should rotate with the camera.

   We can do:

      The entire scene (product-container) rotates, and the cube is fixed inside (by rotating the cube-container in the opposite direction) and the particles are drawn in the canvas and also move with the container? 

   But the particles are drawn in 2D on the canvas. We cannot rotate them in 3D.

   Alternatively, we can simulate the camera rotation by rotating the entire container and then the cube inside is rotated in the opposite direction to appear fixed.

   Then the particles, which are drawn in the canvas, will rotate with the container and thus simulate the camera rotating.

   We'll do:

      .product-container {
         transform-style: preserve-3d;
         animation: rotate 20s infinite linear;
      }

      .product-cube-container {
         transform: rotateY(10deg); /* to counter the rotation so the cube faces the camera */
      }

   But note: the cube should be at the center and the camera (view) is rotating around it. So the cube should not rotate? 

   Actually, we want the cube to rotate independently? Or we want the cube to be fixed and the camera to rotate? 

   We'll do:

      We'll have the cube rotate slowly (like 5 degrees per second) and the camera (container) rotate faster (like 10 degrees per second) in the opposite direction? 

   This is complex.

   Alternatively, we can have the cube fixed and the camera (container) rotating around the cube. Then the cube will appear to rotate in the opposite direction? 

   Actually, if the camera rotates around the cube, the cube will appear to rotate in the opposite direction. 

   We'll do:

      The container (product-container) rotates around the Y axis (like the camera rotating around the cube). 
      Inside, the cube is fixed (no rotation) and the particles are drawn in the canvas and move with the container? 

   But the particles are 2D and will just rotate with the container. 

   We want the particles to be in 3D space? Then we need to use 3D for the particles too? 

   Given the complexity, we'll do:

      We'll have the cube rotating slowly (say 5 degrees per second) and the camera (container) not rotating? 

      And the particles are emitted from the cube and fly outward in random directions, and they are not affected by the cube rotation? 

   This might be simpler.

   We'll have:

      <div class="product-container relative h-[500px] w-full flex justify-center items-center">
        <div class="product-cube-container" style="transform-style: preserve-3d; transform: rotateX(10deg) rotateY(-10deg); animation: rotate 20s infinite linear;">
          ... cube ...
        </div>
        <canvas id="particles" class="absolute inset-0 w-full h-full"></canvas>
      </div>

   The cube rotates continuously. The particles are drawn in the canvas and are independent.

   We'll create particles that are emitted from the center (the cube) and fly outward.

   We'll use JavaScript to create particles and update their positions.

   We'll set the canvas to cover the entire section.

   We'll use the same color scheme for the particles: purple and yellow.

   We'll create a function to create a particle with random direction and speed.

   We'll update the particles on each frame.

   We'll clear the canvas and redraw the particles.

   We'll also draw the cube? No, the cube is in the divs. The canvas is for the particles only.

   So the cube is in the DOM and the particles are in the canvas.

   We'll set the canvas to be above the cube? Then the particles will be behind the cube? 

   We want the particles to be in front? Or behind? 

   We can set the cube to have a higher z-index? 

   We'll set the cube-container to have a higher z-index than the canvas.

   So:

      .product-cube-container { z-index: 10; }
      #particles { z-index: 1; }

   Then the cube is on top of the particles.

   But the particles are behind the cube? Then we cannot see them? 

   We want the particles to be around the cube? 

   We can set the cube-container to have a transparent background? 

   Actually, the cube is made of divs with background colors. We can set the cube to be partially transparent? 

   Alternatively, we can set the particles to be in front? 

   We'll set the cube-container to z-index: 1 and the canvas to z-index: 2 so that the particles are above the cube? 

   Then the particles will be on top of the cube? 

   But we want the particles to be emitted from the cube and then fly away? 

   We can set the cube to have a higher z-index and then the particles that are close to the cube are behind? 

   This is complex.

   We'll set the cube to be at the center and the particles to be drawn in the canvas. We'll set the cube to be opaque? 

   Then the particles that are behind the cube will be hidden? 

   We can set the cube to be transparent? 

   We'll set the cube faces to have a semi-transparent background? 

   Or we can set the particles to be drawn only in the area around the cube? 

   We'll do:

      The canvas covers the entire section, and we draw the particles in the canvas. The cube is in the center and we draw the cube with divs. 

   We'll set the cube to have a higher z-index so that it appears on top of the particles. 

   Then the particles that are behind the cube will be hidden? 

   We can set the cube to be transparent? 

   We'll set the cube faces to have a background with opacity? 

   For example: background: rgba(255,255,255,0.1);

   Then the particles that are behind the cube will be partially visible? 

   We'll try that.

   Alternatively, we can set the cube to be without background and use borders? 

   We'll do:

      .face {
         background: transparent;
         border: 1px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.1);
      }

   Then the cube is a wireframe? 

   We'll go with that.

   Now, let's code the cube:

      We'll create 6 faces:

        front: transform: translateZ(100px);
        back: transform: translateZ(-100px);
        top: transform: rotateX(90deg) translateZ(100px);
        bottom: transform: rotateX(-90deg) translateZ(100px);
        left: transform: rotateY(-90deg) translateZ(100px);
        right: transform: rotateY(90deg) translateZ(100px);

   We'll set the cube to have width and height of 200px, so each face is 200px by 200px.

   We'll set the container to have perspective: 1000px.

   We'll animate the cube to rotate around the Y axis and X axis? 

   We'll do:

      @keyframes rotate {
         from { transform: rotateY(0deg) rotateX(0deg); }
         to { transform: rotateY(360deg) rotateX(360deg); }
      }

   But we want a more natural rotation? 

   We'll do a continuous rotation around the Y axis and a slight rotation around the X axis? 

   We'll do:

      animation: rotate 20s infinite linear;

      @keyframes rotate {
         0% { transform: rotateY(0deg) rotateX(0deg); }
         100% { transform: rotateY(360deg) rotateX(360deg); }
      }

   But that might be too much. We can do only Y axis.

   We'll do:

      @keyframes rotate {
         0% { transform: rotateY(0deg); }
         100% { transform: rotateY(360deg); }
      }

   Now, for the particles:

      We'll create an array of particles.

      Each particle has:
         x, y, z (position)
         vx, vy, vz (velocity)
         color (random between purple and yellow)
         size (random)

      We'll initialize the particles near the center (the cube) and then move them outward.

      We'll update the particles on each frame and redraw.

      We'll use requestAnimationFrame.

      We'll set the canvas to the size of the container.

      We'll handle window resize.

   We'll write the JavaScript for the particles in a separate function.

   We'll add the canvas and the cube in the new section.

   We'll call the section "Product Showcase".

   We'll put it after the "Key Features" section.

   We'll also add the necessary CSS for the cube.

   We'll add the CSS for the cube in a style tag.

   We'll also add the JavaScript for the particles at the end of the existing script.

   We'll create a function to create particles and update them.

   We'll use the same color variables as the template.

   Let's code.
